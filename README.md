# Computational neuroscience

This repository contains the code I used for a series of articles on
computational neuroscience. The articles are designed designed for students
eager to learn about computational neuroscience, and contain explanations as
well as programming examples. The articles in question are:

- [Spike train simulations](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2023-08-08-Spikes/)
- [Adaptive integrate-and-fire models](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-01-01-Adaptive/)
- [Leaky integrate-and-fire models](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-01-01-Leaky/)
- [The Hodgkin-Huxley model](https://slopezpereyra.github.io/2024-01-03-HodgkeyHuxley/)

Because the code in this repository had the explicit purpose of illustrating
examples and models in the articles. The reader should not expect to find here
a coherent and cohesive program, but a collection of implementations in the 
field of computational neuroscience. Though the implementations are entirely 
my own, the articles are inspired in Dayan and Abbot's *Theoretical neuroscience*.
