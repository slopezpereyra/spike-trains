mutable struct SpikeTrain
    """Struct representation of a spike train with a firing rate that is a 
    non-constant function of time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : number > 0 
        Duration of the trial.
    Δt : number > 0
        Size of the infinitesimally small bins that split the time domain.
    tuncurve : TuningCurve
        The TuningCurve struct represents the function that governs the 
        variation of r = f(s), the firing rate as a function of a stimulus 
        parameter. The stimulus parameter is on its turn  a function s = g(t) 
        of time.
    stimcurve : function
        A periodic mapping from ℝ to ℝ that is the function s(t) of a stimulus
        parameter with respect to time. Periodicity must be imposed into
        whatever function describes the stimulus across time for some of the
        calculations to make sense. Such condition is often easy to impose
        using standard mathematical methods even on non-periodic functions.

    spike_train : Vector{Int}

        The TuningCurve instance that represents the function that governs the 
        variation of r = f(s), the firing rate as a function of a stimulus 
        parameter. The stimulus parameter is on its turn  a function s = g(t)

    If a spike vector ω ∈ {0, 1}ⁿ is defined s.t.

    where tᵢ∈ ℝ is the time corresponding to the ith time bin, with i ∈ ℕ s.t. 
    1 ≤ i ≤ n, then a spike matrix Ω is an n × n matrix whose row vectors are 
    spike vectors.

    The struct SpikeMatrix represents such Ω matrix with some of its relevant
    properties according to my own research. It is trivial to observe that ⟨ρ⟩
    is the average row vector. Non-trivial properties exist that pertain to 
    the spectrum of Ω. Generally speaking, the Perron eigenvalue 𝒫 (Ω) is a 
    functon of σ and 𝕊(f), the variance and supremum of the tuning curve f.
    The corresponding Perron eigenvector α is s.t. 

                                α ≈ ⟨ρ⟩

    at least in shape. Further research on the reason why the coefficients of α
    share almost the same proportionality than those of ⟨ρ⟩ is due. The reason 
    why 𝒫 (Ω) is a function of σ and S(f) is elaborated in a research note 
    that I made public on my website.
